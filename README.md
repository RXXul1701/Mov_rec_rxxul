# AI Movie Recommender System

## Overview
This project implements a  content-based AI movie recommender system using Python, Jupyter, and Streamlit. The recommender system is based on the bag of words algorithm and provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences.
The project also includes a Jupyter notebook (`movie_recommender.ipynb`) where the bag of words algorithm is implemented and trained using a dataset of movie reviews. Additionally, a Streamlit web application (`app.py`) has been created to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing the movie recommendation system.
